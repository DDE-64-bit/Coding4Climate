# üå± Coding4Climate Welcome to **Coding4Climate** 
 
I‚Äôve built a web app that allows you to upload a photo of a location and receive direct, AI-generated tips on how to stimulate biodiversity in that specific area.

## üöÄ How to Use (Locally) 

Clone the repository and run the app with the following steps: 

### 1. Set up a virtual environment 
**Linux / macOS:** 

```
python3 -m venv env source env/bin/activate
``` 

**Windows (CMD):** 

```
python -m venv env env\Scripts\activate
``` 

### 2. Install dependencies 

```
pip install openai flask pillow
``` 

### 3. Clone the repo 

```
git clone https://github.com/DDE-64-bit/Coding4Climate.git cd Coding4Climate/src
```

### 4. Set API key

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='this-is-a-very-very-secret-key'
```

### 5. Run the app 

```
python app.py
``` 
Now open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to try it out!  

Alternatively you can also go in the code and switch for the ```natureAgent``` the ```model``` and the ```openAI``` parameter to ```{local model of your choice from ollama}``` and ```False```. Than you can run your AI webapp completly local!


## üåç What It Does 
Upload a photo of a place ‚Äî a backyard, a field, a street ‚Äî and the AI will analyze it and give you **concrete suggestions** to help nature reclaim the space and boost biodiversity.  

## üí° Why? 
Small changes in our environment can have big impacts on local ecosystems. This tool helps make those changes more visible, accessible, and actionable. 

## ü§ñ Powered by
 - GPT-4o via OpenAI or any local model from ollama
 - Flask (Python web framework) 
 - Pillow (image handling) 
 - Custom agent logic (full AI agent SDK coming soon!)
